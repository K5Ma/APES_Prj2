**********v1.0**********

>*What's New?*

>>Raw Code - EPaper (UART7), ADC, and reading 1 byte on SPI (Problematic SPI driver, incorrect setting for SS pin on PM6)


**********v1.1********** (4/18/2019)

>*What's New?*

>>Raw Code - BME280 (on SPI (SSI0) - yet to add all config features), NFC Module (UART5), Load Cell (with HX711, digital 2 wire (non standard) interface)


>*What's Changed/Updated?*

>>Null

>>Raw Code - EPaper (UART7), ADC


>*What's Removed?*

>>Null


**********v1.2********** (4/20/2019)

>*What's New?*

>>Raw Code - Servo (PWM), SpeakJet (UART6), Buzzer (PWM)


>*What's Changed/Updated?*

>>Standalone Driver - EPaper v1.0, LoadCell v1.0 - Both having properly defined and clean interfaces, comments, and local error handling - Updated from Raw Code
