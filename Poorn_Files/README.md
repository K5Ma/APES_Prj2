**********v1.0**********
>>>>> What's New?
Raw Code - EPaper (UART7), ADC, and reading 1 byte on SPI (Problematic SPI driver, incorrect setting for SS pin on PM6)

**********v1.1********** (4/18/2019)

>>>>> What's New?
Raw Code - BME280 (on SPI (SSI0) - yet to add all config features), NFC Reader (UART5), Load Cell (with HX711, digital 2 wire (non standard) interface)

>>>>> What's Changed/Updated?
Null

>>>>> What's the Same?
Raw Code - EPaper (UART7), ADC

>>>>> What's Removed?
Null

**********v1.2********** (4/20/2019)

>>>>> What's New?
Raw Code - Servo (PWM), SpeakJet (UART6), Buzzer (PWM)

>>>>> What's Changed/Updated?
Standalone Driver - EPaper v1.0, LoadCell v1.0 - Both having properly defined and clean interfaces, comments, and local error handling - Updated from Raw Code

>>>>> What's the Same?
Raw Code - BME280 (on SPI (SSI0) - yet to add all config features), NFC Reader (UART5)

>>>>> What's Removed?
Raw Code - ADC (Temporarily commented out)
